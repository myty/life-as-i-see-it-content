Did you ever go outside when it was really cold, get whacked in the face by a snowball thrown by some kid you canâ€™t stand? Your next move is to take off running after them in an effort to make them pay for their misdeed? The air is super brisk and thin and as you run your lungs begin to burn and your head throbs and you get a little dizzy? That sensation is me.
