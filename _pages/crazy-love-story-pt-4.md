The next morning, I began executing my next move. I punched his band’s name into a search engine and Viola!…there he was. Not quite as attractive as I had remembered him from the night before, but it was him, my future husband. I skimmed, okay I confess, I read and reread every blog on that website. They were all written by him! This meant, that if I sent an email to the “fan page” HE would be the one to respond. Of course as I am contemplating my words, good ole Uncle Willie couldn’t be more amused with my insanity. It didn’t help that as I was drafting my email, I was also scanning bridal sites for a dress. What?!? I am a multi-tasker, what can I say? I finalize my letter which goes a little (ok, a LOT like this)
“Dear (band name here),
I just want to thank you so much for coming out to ____________Church. The youth group really enjoyed your music. I hope you enjoyed yourselves also. We would love to have you back again soon!”

Ok, so I went to the youth group once, and now I am their official spokeswoman. I am so shady. Maybe I was just foreseeing things to come. I was later asked to be a youth leader and accepted. I loved every minute of it! That being said, I signed my name and pushed SEND. Now that ball was in his court, all I could do was wait! I picked the color scheme for the wedding, checked out a couple of ring options and did my normal single mom routine.
I wouldn’t have to wait long to get a response. And guess who authored that email? Oh, just my future husband, Michael. B-I-N-G-O!

I am doing the happy dance. Uncle Willie is rolling his eyes. Wedding bells are ringing!
